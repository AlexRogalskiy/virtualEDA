## How to add Resources

If you would like to add resources to the `learning` section of the website please raise a Pull Request with your resource.

You can find our current resources in the `resources/general` folder. We use markdown for resources.

There are currently three types of resources

- code
- videos
- articles

(If you wish to add more types feel free, you will need to make sure an Icon for your type is added within the repo).
